# CBN-EXCHANGE-RATE
this was project i did , trying to scrap data from the cbn website to track the rate changes over time and i add visuals with tableau
the process was simple not too complicated ;
first thing i did was going to the official website, looking for the data , then using inspect , to get the html code for the datas i want 
and i took it to pycharm to turn the codes into a more readable data
after i was done with that , i had to take the table to excel sheet to analyze the data , to see if there are missing information , also if the data needed
rearrangement 
thirdly , i was able to clean up the data , i saved and imported to tableau to create the visuals , which was challenging cause of the dates are much and how they appeared in tableau 
files of the visuals the html file and excel sheet have been attached to this folder
